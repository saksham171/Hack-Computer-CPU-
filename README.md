## HACK Computer

ALU.hdl is taken from previous assignment.
CPU.hdl is CPU chip which is used in Computer.
Memory.hdl is Memory chip which is used in Computer.
All other files are taken from previous assignments.

### 1)  d=a+b-c
All Q1 files are for this program. Which include .asm, .hack, .tst, .cmp, .out.

### 2)  c=abs(a-b)
All Q2 files are for this program. Which include .asm, .hack, .tst, .cmp, .out.

### 3)  sum from 1 to 100
All Q3 files are for this program. Which include .asm, .hack, .tst, .cmp, .out.

We have not included .tst, .cmp, .out files for CPU and Memory chip. As we can see their correctness from Computer.hdl itself.
